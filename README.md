As below is part of the user story:
1. As McDonald's normal customer, after I submitted my order, I wish to see my order flow into "PENDING" area. After the cooking bot process my order, I want to see it flow into to "COMPLETE" area.
2. As McDonald's VIP member, after I submitted my order, I want my order being process first before all order by normal customer.  However if there's existing order from VIP member, my order should queue behind his/her order.
3. As McDonald's manager, I want to increase or decrease number of cooking bot available in my restaurant. When I increase a bot, it should immediately process any pending order. When I decrease a bot, the processing order should remain un-process.
4. As McDonald bot, it can only pickup and process 1 order at a time, each order required 10 seconds to complete process.
